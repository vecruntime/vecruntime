 * {@link AggKernels}. Beyond {@link #LOW_CARDINALITY} groups the accumulators
 * scatter row by row instead.
 *
 * <p>The threshold is deliberately tiny. With interleaved groups every 64-row
 * block is a partial mask, and on 128-bit SIMD (2 double lanes) building a lane
 * mask per pair of rows costs more than the reduction saves: measured on Apple
 * M3, the mask path is 2x faster with one group but 1.6x slower with 4 groups
 * and 5x slower with 16 (GroupedAggBenchmark). Wider registers move the
 * break-even point; the threshold can be tuned per platform.
