/**
 * Planner strategy for the columnar v3 deletion-vector writer (#20, slice 4-live). It intercepts the
 * logical [[WriteDelta]] -- the merge-on-read DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE write -- and, when the target writes
 * deletion vectors (format version 3) and the write is delete-only, plans [[VectorWriteDeltaExec]] so
 * the DELETE half runs columnar. For anything else -- the flag off, the bridge/Iceberg absent, a v2
 * table, or a write that also inserts rows (UPDATE/MERGE with a data half, out of scope until slice 5)
 * -- it returns `Nil`, so Spark's own `DataSourceV2Strategy` plans the ordinary `WriteDeltaExec` and
 * the fallback is Spark's real writer, unchanged. The reason is logged when explain-fallback is on.
 *
 * Injected through `SparkSessionExtensions.injectPlannerStrategy`; strategies Spark tries before its
 * own, so returning a non-empty plan wins and returning `Nil` cedes to Spark.
