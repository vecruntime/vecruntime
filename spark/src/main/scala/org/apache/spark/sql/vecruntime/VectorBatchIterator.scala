 * Lifecycle rules:
 *  - an output batch we built is closed when the consumer asks for the next one (Spark's
 *    columnar iterators never close batches; the producer reuses or releases them);
 *  - an input batch may be passed through untouched (e.g. a filter that keeps every row); it is
 *    then owned by the child and never closed here;
 *  - the per-task Arrow child allocator is closed from a task-completion listener after the last
 *    emitted batch has been released.
