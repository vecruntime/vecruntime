/**
 * `monotonically_increasing_id()`: Spark's contract is `partitionIndex.toLong << 33 | rowNumber`,
 * with the row number counting the rows that reach the expression within the partition. The
 * compiled expression tree is deserialised once per task, so the counter below is per task -- one
 * partition -- exactly like Spark's `Stateful` implementation; the partition prefix is read from the
 * task context on first use.
 *
 * With a forwarded selection only the selected rows are numbered, in order: those are the rows
 * Spark would have seen after the filter below; unselected lanes are masked by the consumer.
 * Rows outside an `active` mask (a CASE branch) are still numbered -- Spark evaluates the id only on
 * the branch's rows, a difference this node accepts rather than reproducing, since the id is a tag
 * and only its monotonicity and uniqueness within the partition are contractual.
