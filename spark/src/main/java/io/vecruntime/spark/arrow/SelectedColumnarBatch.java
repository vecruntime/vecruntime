/**
 * A batch whose rows are qualified by a selection bitmap instead of being
 * compacted. Emitted by a spark-vector operator only when its parent is another
 * spark-vector operator (Spark's own consumers would read every row), so a
 * filter feeding an aggregate never copies the surviving rows: the aggregate
 * folds the selection into its validity masks.
 *
 * <p>{@link #numRows()} is the physical row count of the columns; {@link
 * #selectedCount()} the number of qualifying rows. The selection lives in this
 * batch's own arena, which is released when the batch is closed. Columns are
 * closed only if {@code ownsColumns}; a filter borrows its child's columns (the
 * child releases them when it produces its next batch), a projection owns the
 * vectors it built.
