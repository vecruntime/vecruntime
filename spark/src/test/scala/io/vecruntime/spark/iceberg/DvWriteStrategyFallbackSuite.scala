/**
 * Gate-visible tests for the columnar v3 deletion-vector writer's DECLINE paths (#20, slice 4-live).
 *
 * The correctness suite for the operator itself (`VectorDvWriteSuite`) lives in the optional
 * `iceberg-bridge` module, which CI's gate (`-pl kernels,spark,shuffle,benchmarks`) does not build, so
 * it is run manually (see docs/iceberg-dv-writer.md). This suite runs INSIDE the gate's spark module,
 * where the bridge is by construction absent from the classpath, and asserts the other half of the
 * contract: whenever the strategy must decline -- the flag is off, the target is a v2 table, the write
 * has an insert half (UPDATE / MERGE, slice 5), or the bridge module is not present -- Spark's own
 * `WriteDeltaExec` plans instead and the DELETE / UPDATE / MERGE result is correct and unchanged.
 *
 * `VectorWriteDeltaExec` must therefore NEVER appear in a plan built in this module. The check is by
 * simple class name so it does not depend on the operator being loadable here.
