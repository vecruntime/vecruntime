/**
 * Slice 1 of the option-B DV-writer plan (#20): a LOCAL timing split of the v3 merge-on-read write
 * stage into delete-writing (deletion vectors, Puffin) vs data-writing (Parquet data files), so the
 * design's gain estimate is a number rather than a range before any writer is built.
 *
 * It is a profiling probe, not a correctness assertion: it prints a table and asserts only that the
 * three phases ran and produced the delete/data files we expect. Attribution is by isolating the two
 * halves the CDC MERGE fuses, on the same v3 table shape, driven by Spark's own row writer (the
 * plugin is off): a pure `DELETE` writes only deletion vectors (no data files), a pure append of the
 * merge's inserted rows writes only Parquet data files (no deletes), and the real `MERGE` does both.
 * The delete-writer share of the write is then delete-task-time / (delete + data task time), and the
 * MERGE's own write-stage task time is reported beside it as the ground truth those two sum toward.
