/**
 * SQL correctness coverage ported from DataFusion Comet's expression suites
 * (`CometBitwiseExpressionSuite`, `CometMathExpressionSuite`, `CometExpressionSuite`), adapted to
 * spark-vector's validation model: every query is run twice on the same session with
 * `spark.vecruntime.enabled` toggled and the rows compared (Comet's `checkSparkAnswerAndOperator`),
 * while asserting the projection ran on our operator (`VectorProjectExec`). This is the second
 * coverage lever of the SQL-coverage survey: the golden-file suite already runs the whole
 * enumerable universe of Spark's `sql-tests/inputs`, so the gain is data-driven expression cases
 * checked against Spark itself rather than more golden files.
 *
 * The cases are limited to expressions the kernels implement and whose Spark semantics are pinned
 * in `docs/expressions.md`: the bitwise family (`& | ^ ~`, `shiftleft`/`shiftright`/
 * `shiftrightunsigned`, `bit_count`) over the INT32 and INT64 lanes, and the math family
 * (`abs`/`signum`, the transcendental unary and binary functions, the log family, `%`/`pmod`,
 * `greatest`/`least`, `rint`) over the FLOAT64 lane. Doubles are compared with the base suite's
 * tolerance; the transcendental kernels are bit-identical to Spark, so the log/trig cases pass at
 * tolerance 0 too, but the shared comparison already covers that.
 *
 * These run in legacy (non-ANSI) arithmetic so the overflow / divide-by-zero rows null rather than
 * raise -- the correctness of the ANSI raises themselves is a separate suite's concern (the golden
 * files under `nonansi/` cover them). A case that DID uncover an engine bug would be marked
 * `ignore` here with a one-line reason and a minimal repro in the PR, per the task's rule not to
 * fix engine code in a coverage change; none did on this slice.
