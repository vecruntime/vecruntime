/**
 * SQL correctness coverage ported from DataFusion Comet's `CometWindowExecSuite`, adapted to
 * spark-vector's plugin-on/plugin-off comparison model: every window query is run twice on one
 * session with `spark.vecruntime.enabled` toggled, the rows compared, and a `VectorWindowExec` asserted
 * in the accelerated plan (a frame or function we don't accelerate asserts fallback with its reason).
 *
 * This is the window slice of the SQL-coverage survey. It complements the hand-written
 * `VectorWindowSuite` (which pins the ranking walk, the held-partition aggregate/offset paths, the
 * sliding frames, the `WindowGroupLimit` top-k and the fallback reasons in depth) by adding Comet's
 * data-driven window matrix in the exact shapes its suite checks over a small `(a, b, c)` table:
 * COUNT(*) without a frame, SUM/AVG with PARTITION BY (and ORDER BY), decimal AVG and SUM over a
 * running `ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING ... CURRENT ROW` frame (ours since #259), MIN/MAX with ORDER BY,
 * the ROWS-between frame family (`UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`, `CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED
 * FOLLOWING`, `n PRECEDING AND m FOLLOWING`, `n PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`, `CURRENT ROW AND n
 * FOLLOWING`, `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`), ROW_NUMBER/RANK/DENSE_RANK/PERCENT_RANK/
 * NTILE with PARTITION BY and ORDER BY, LAG/LEAD (default offset, offset+default), FIRST_VALUE,
 * LAST_VALUE over a ROWS frame and NTH_VALUE.
 *
 * It also pins the shapes Comet documents as *not* accelerated or as errors, which are contracts
 * `docs/operators.md` also records: a RANGE frame with a value offset falls back, a RANGE frame whose
 * lower bound is FOLLOWING falls back, `IGNORE NULLS` on lag/lead falls back, and a non-literal
 * lag/lead offset or default is a Spark *analysis error* (not a fallback) that both engines raise.
 * Where a shape uncovered an engine bug the case is `ignore`d with a one-line reason and a minimal
 * repro in the PR, per the task's rule not to fix engine code in a coverage change.
 *
 * The table mirrors Comet's fixture: `w(a, b, c)` with small integer partition/order/value columns,
 * ties in the order key, a null partition, a null value, plus a decimal measure `d` for the decimal
 * running-frame cases -- written as Parquet so the scan is columnar.
