/**
 * Cached tables (#55, level 1: consume the cache). `InMemoryTableScanExec` emits columnar batches
 * only when Spark's `DefaultCachedBatchSerializer` agrees to, and it agrees only for a cached
 * relation whose *whole* schema is boolean/byte/short/int/long/float/double -- a string, date,
 * timestamp or decimal column anywhere in the cached relation makes the scan a row scan, whatever
 * the query projects. When it is columnar, the batches (Spark's on-heap vectors) feed our operators
 * through the adapter seam's copy like any other Spark columnar scan.
