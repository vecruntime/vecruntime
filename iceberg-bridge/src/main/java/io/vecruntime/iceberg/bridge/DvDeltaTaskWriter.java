 * delta rows arrive already clustered by {@code _spec_id}/{@code _partition}/
 * {@code _file} from the write's REBALANCE exchange), and produces the per-task
 * {@link WriterCommitMessage} the driver hands to Iceberg's own {@code

 * serialisation ({@link ColumnarDvWriter} → {@code BaseDVFileWriter}), the
 * merge of a data file's previously committed deletion vector ({@code
 * BaseDVFileWriter.close()} via the {@link DeleteLoader} loader below), and the
 * commit-message assembly ({@link IcebergDvCommitBridge}). The only thing that
 * is ours is filling each file's index from a run of positions in one call
 * instead of routing one {@code InternalRow} at a time.
