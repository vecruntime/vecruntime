/**
 * The columnar deletion-vector build (#20, slice 3). One instance per write
 * task: for each run of rows sharing a data file path, {@link #deleteFile}
 * builds a {@link PositionDeleteIndex} from that run's positions and hands the
 * whole file's positions to Iceberg's public {@link
 * BaseDVFileWriter#delete(String, PositionDeleteIndex, PartitionSpec,
 * StructLike)} in one call, instead of Spark's row-at-a-time {@code
 * delete(row)}. {@link #result()} (after {@link #close()}) is Iceberg's {@link
 * DeleteWriteResult}: the writer has serialised each bitmap into one Puffin
 * blob and merged any previous DV for the file through the loader.
 *
 * <p>This is deliberately thin — the bitmap encoding, the Puffin serialisation,
 * the previous-DV merge and the {@code DeleteFile} metadata are all Iceberg's;
 * the only thing that is ours is filling the index from column runs rather than
 * one {@code InternalRow} at a time.
