/**
 * Same-package bridge for the columnar v3 deletion-vector writer (#20, option
 * B). It lives in {@code org.apache.iceberg.spark.source} so it can call the
 * package-private {@link SparkPositionDeltaWrite.DeltaTaskCommit} constructors
 * — the one piece of the write path that Iceberg does not expose publicly. The
 * plugin core has no compile-time Iceberg dependency and reaches this class
 * reflectively (its methods take and return only Iceberg / Spark public types,
 * so the reflective signatures are stable), exactly as it reaches Iceberg's
 * reader.
 *
 * <p>This class assembles ONLY the per-task commit message and hands off
 * construction of the deletion vectors to Iceberg's public {@link
 * org.apache.iceberg.deletes.BaseDVFileWriter} (see {@link
 * io.vecruntime.iceberg.bridge.ColumnarDvWriter}); the driver-side commit
 * stays Iceberg's own {@code RowDelta} through {@code
 * DeltaBatchWrite.commit(messages)}, so nothing about snapshot semantics,
 * metrics or previous-DV bookkeeping is reimplemented here. (The previous-DV
 * merge is Iceberg's too: {@code BaseDVFileWriter.close()} merges any prior
 * vector for a data file through the loader the caller supplies, which is built
 * from Iceberg's public {@code DeleteLoader}, not from the private {@code
 * PreviousDeleteLoader} nested here.)
