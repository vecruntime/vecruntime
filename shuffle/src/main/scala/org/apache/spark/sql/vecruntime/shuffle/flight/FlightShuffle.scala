/**
 * The Arrow Flight data plane of the columnar shuffle (#288, slice 3). Every executor runs one
 * [[FlightServer]] on the block manager's host and an ephemeral port; a reducer's `DoGet` names one
 * map output's partition -- `(shuffleId, mapId, reducePartition)` -- and the server streams that
 * block's IPC bytes straight from the shuffle file the slice-2 writer produced, as chunks of a
 * one-column binary stream (#338: Flight's own record-batch framing sends dictionaries once per
 * stream, and our blocks carry a replacement dictionary per record batch). Each block is one Flight
 * stream; coalescing an executor's blocks into one stream is a follow-up.
 *
 * Locations travel through the plugin: the executor plugin starts the server and registers
 * `executorId -> host:port` with the driver plugin; reducers look a location up once per executor
 * and cache it ([[FlightRegistry]]).
 *
 * Security: with `spark.authenticate` on, every call must carry Spark's shuffle secret as a bearer
 * token and an unauthenticated `DoGet` is refused; the server refuses to start when auth is on but
 * no secret can be read. TLS follows `spark.ssl.rpc.enabled` (slice 3 documents the gap: the
 * server needs PEM material, Spark configures JKS; until a converter lands, TLS-on refuses to start
 * so nothing runs in the clear by accident). Without `spark.authenticate` the endpoint is as open as
 * Spark's own block transfer in that configuration.
