/**
 * The training run behind the executor's AOT cache (#416).
 *
 * The JDK's AOT cache (JEP 483/515) holds the classes a JVM loaded and linked, and the method
 * profiles it gathered, in a training run; a later JVM started with `-XX:AOTCache` skips the
 * class loading, linking and interpreter warm-up for them. At 1000 partitions a query's tasks
 * are short enough that our executors spent their first stages in the interpreter (q18: 2.7x
 * behind Spark cold, parity warm), and a cache trained on other queries took 27% off q18's
 * executor time. This program is that training run, done once at image build: Spark in local
 * mode on our engine and our shuffle, over synthetic tables that carry every lane type, through
 * every operator we have -- scan adapter, project and filter with the expression kernels, hash
 * aggregate (partial and final, over our exchange) on every key kind, broadcast, shuffled and
 * sort-merge joins in every join type, window, sort, top-k, expand and rollup, union, limit,
 * generate, sample -- each statement several times so the profiles are hot. Also the shuffle
 * writer and reader over dictionary strings, decimals and nulls.
 *
 * It is built to run as `train.sh` runs it: on the executor's class path (`/opt/spark/jars`, wildcard)
 * with the executor's JVM options, since the cache is only used by a JVM whose class path and
 * module options match the training run's. What it computes is irrelevant; what it exercises
 * is the point, so the queries are chosen for the code paths they take, not for their answers.
 *
 * {{{
